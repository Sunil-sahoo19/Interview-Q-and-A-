#1. Difference b/w port & socket. ?

--> PORT

*A port is just a number.
*It helps your computer know which application or service the data should go to.

Example:

 *Port 80 → Websites (HTTP)
 *Port 443 → Secure websites (HTTPS)
 *Port 3306 → MySQL database 


 --> SOCKET

*A socket is a combination of:

  *IP Address
  *Port Number
  *Protocol (TCP/UDP)

*Used to create a real connection between devices.
*It allows two computers to send/receive data.


#2. What is WebSocket?

WebSocket is a technology that allows the client (browser) and server to communicate with each other continuously in real time.

--> Normally (HTTP request-response):

Client sends a request
Server sends a response
Connection closes

--> With WebSocket:

Client and server open a single connection
They can send messages to each other anytime
Connection stays open
No need to request again and again


--> Where WebSockets are used?

 *Chat applications
 *Online gaming
 *Live score updates
 *Stock price updates
 *Multiplayer apps
 *Real-time notifications
