@1. What is UML ?

UML = Unified Modeling Language
UML is like a drawing language for programmers
it helps you plan and design software using diagrams instead of only writing code.

Think of it like blueprints for a building 
before building a house, you draw a plan.
Similarly, before writing a program, developers use UML to draw how the system will work.

Why We Use UML

* To understand and explain how the system works
* To plan before writing code
* To find problems early
* To communicate ideas between developers, designers, and clients

IN Short<<<
UML = A visual way to plan and explain how software works
Like a map for developers before they start coding


@2. What is schema ?

* Definition  

A schema is the structure of a database — it defines tables, columns, data types, and relationships between them.

A Schema is like a blueprint or structure that defines how data is organized in a database.
Think of it like a plan of a house 
it shows where each room (table) is, what’s inside it (columns), and how they connect.

Types of Schemas (in databases):

*Logical Schema → shows structure (tables, columns, relationships)
*Physical Schema → shows how data is stored on the system
*View Schema → shows how users see data


@3. What is DROP TABLE in (SQL) ?

The DROP TABLE command is used to delete an entire table from the database —
including all its data, structure, and relationships.
