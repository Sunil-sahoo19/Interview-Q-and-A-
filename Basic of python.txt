#Q1. What is an variables ?

A variable is a named container that stores a value or piece of data in a program.
It's called a "variable" because the value it holds can change during program execution.

--> Variables have three key parts: a name (how you refer to it) a data type (what kind of data it holds),
and a value (the actual data stored).​

In essence, variables allow you to store information that can be reused and modified throughout your code, 
making programs flexible and dynamic rather than having fixed values hardcoded everywhere.​

#Q2. What is Fu0nction ?

A function in programming is a named block of code designed to perform a specific task.
Functions take input values (called parameters), process them, and often return an output. 
This lets you reuse instructions, organize code, and solve complex problems by breaking them into smaller steps.​

--> In short: Functions enable code reuse, clarity, and modularity by packaging related operations together for use
 anywhere in your program.

#Q3. 0What is Loop ?

A loop in programming is a control structure that repeatedly executes a block of code as long 
as a specified condition is true. Loops let you automate repetitive tasks, making code more efficient 
and reducing manual repetition.

--> There are Three type of Loops:

* For loop : Runs a set number of times, best when you know how many repetitions are needed
* While Loop :  Continues as long as a condition stays true, often used when the number of iterations isn't known in advance
* Do-while loop: Similar to the while loop, but guarantees that the code runs at least once before checking the condition.

#Q4. What is Classes ?

A class in programming, especially in object-oriented programming (OOP), is a blueprint or template for creating objects. 
It defines what data (called attributes or properties) and behavior (called methods or functions) its objects will have.

Classes help organize code by grouping related data and functions together, making programming more modular and reusable.
When you create an actual item from a class, it's called an object or instance of that class.


--> Example code:

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # variable for name
        self.age = age    # variable for age

    def say_hello(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")

people = [Person("Alice", 25), Person("Bob", 30), Person("Charlie", 35)]  # list of Person objects

for person in people:  # loop
    person.say_hello()  # function call
