1. What is cloud computing? -->

Cloud computing means storing, managing, and processing Data on the internet ( cloud) instead of using your own computer.

Simple Example:

When you upload photos to Google Drive or iCloud,
â†’ Youâ€™re using cloud computing.

* The files are not on your laptop â€” theyâ€™re stored on Googleâ€™s or Appleâ€™s cloud servers.

<!-- Main Services in Cloud Computing: --> 

IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
 Rent servers, storage, and networks.
Example: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine

PaaS (Platform as a Service)
 Developers build and run apps without worrying about hardware.
Example: Google App Engine, Heroku

SaaS (Software as a Service)
 Use apps directly through the internet.
Example: Gmail, Zoom, Microsoft 365 

<!-- Benefits: -->
Access from anywhere
Pay only for what you use
No need for your own server or data center
Scalable (you can increase storage or power anytime)

Cloud computing means using the internet as your computer â€” storing files, running apps, and managing data online instead of locally.

 An LLM is a smart computer program that can read, write, and understand language â€” almost like a human.


<!-- 4. what is vibe coding ? -->


You describe your idea in plain language or prompts (e.g., with a large language model like GPTâ€‘4). 
The AI generates much of the actual code for you. 


<!-- Important to know (the pros & cons): -->

Pros.

You can build faster and with less manual coding. 
Great for prototypes, quick tools, or for beginners who donâ€™t know all the syntax.

Cons. 

The generated code might be less understandable or harder to maintain
It can introduce bugs or security issues if not reviewed.


<!-- 5. what is micro service ? -->

Microservices = Small, independent parts of a big application that work together through APIs.

<!-- Real-World Example: -->

Netflix uses microservices for streaming, recommendations, payments, etc.
Amazon uses them for orders, payments, delivery tracking.


<!-- 6. What is AWS , Lambda , Kinesis ?  -->

AWS = Amazon Web Services
AWS is a cloud computing platform by Amazon.

<!-- It provides online services that let you: -->

Store data 
Run code or applications
Host websites 
Use databases 
And many more....

<!-- Benefits of AWS: -->

 Pay only for what you use
 Scalable â€” handles 10 users or 10 million
 Very secure
 Used by big companies like Netflix, Airbnb, Amazon, Swiggy, and Zomato

<!-- AWS Lambda -->

Definition:

AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service from Amazon Web Services (AWS).
It lets you run your code without managing any servers.

You just write your Python code 
and AWS runs it automatically only when needed.

<!-- When to Use AWS Lambda: -->

Automatically resize an image when itâ€™s uploaded 
Send email notifications 
Process payments 
Trigger small background tasks
Create APIs using services like API Gateway + Lambda

<!--  Advantages: -->

 No need to manage servers
 Pay only for use

 Easy to use with Python, Node.js, Java, etc.


 <!-- What is AWS Kinesis? -->

 Definition:

AWS Kinesis is used to handle real-time data streams â€” meaning data that is continuously flowing.

<!-- Example: -->

A live stock price app 
A live chat system 
A live video analytics feed 
All sending lots of data every second!

Kinesis collects that fast-moving data, processes it, and sends it to where itâ€™s needed (like a database or dashboard) in real time.

<!-- Simple Use Case: -->

Netflix uses Kinesis to track what users are watching right now
Amazon uses it to track millions of sales per second


<!-- 7. What do you mean by AI, Perplexity, Chatgpt, Grok Ai ?  -->

AI Means machines or computer that can think, Learn and make decisions like Humans.
AI is the science behind intelligent machines, chatgpt and grok  Ai are chatbots that use LLMs to understand and talk like humans, While perplexity Ai is an Ai-powered search engine that answers using real data and source.
