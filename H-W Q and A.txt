1. # What is Vulnerability

A. Definition of Vulnerability:

A vulnerability is a weakness or flaw in a system, software, network, or even human process that 
can be exploited by attackers to cause harm or gain unauthorized access.

* A vulnerability is a security gap that allows hackers to break into a system, steal data, or damage operations.

Examples:

 Software Bug — a programming mistake that lets someone bypass login.

 Unpatched System — outdated software without security updates.

 Weak Passwords — like “12345” or “password”.

 Phishing Links — users clicking unsafe links due to lack of awareness.

 Open Network Ports — allowing outsiders to access a system.


2. What is SIT Testing ?

A. The SIT Stands for SIT = System Integration Testing. 

*Meaning
It’s a type of testing done after individual modules are tested (after unit testing) to check 
how all modules work together as a system.


Purpose:

*Data flows correctly between modules
*Interfaces between components work properly
*No issues occur when different parts are combined


3. what is SAT Testing ?

* The SAT Stands for SAT = System Acceptance Testing

* Meaning 

This is done after SIT, and it’s the final level of testing before delivering the system to the client.
It checks whether the entire system meets the user’s requirements.

main Purpose:
* To ensure the system works in real-world conditions as expected by the end user or client.

Example:

After SIT passes, the client or testers perform SAT to:

*Check if all business needs are met
*Verify performance, usability, and reliability
*Ensure the system is ready for deployment.
